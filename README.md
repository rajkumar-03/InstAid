In our application InstAid we used machine learning and deep learning algorithms to train highly accurate models

When a user inputs information about the condition of their body, InstAid can estimate whether or not the individual will suffer from a disease.

Thus allowing users to check their chance of having one of the following diseases:
         1)Liver Disease
         2)Pneumonia Disease
         3)Kidney Disease
         4)Diabete Disease
         5)Stroke Disease
         6)Heart Disease
